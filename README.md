# Password Generator Starter Code

-- created variables with arrays for each variable that was going to need a function

-- created a function to create a prompt asking for the length of the password 

-- use if statement to specify the length of the password and created an alert if they are under or exceeding character limits

-- created functions for all the other variables with boolean statements and a for loop

-- variables also include tmp variables to hold temporary information and console logs

-- created an expression so the base variables have a loop and passing the value from the function to return the code
